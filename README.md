Hi, I'm Anirban, also known as @yarnabrina across various online platforms like RStudio Community, Stack Overflow, and social media. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

ðŸ“š I have a keen interest in books and enjoy indulging in (very very) casual gaming in my free time.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm exploring different technologies and frameworks to expand my skill set. I'm particularly excited about learning new programming languages and deepening my knowledge in data science.

ðŸ’¡ As part of my work, I heavily rely on open-source packages and tools. I believe in the power of collaboration and giving back to the community. I actively contribute to open-source projects by providing bug reports, user feedback, and code contributions whenever possible.

ðŸš€ One of the projects I'm most passionate about is `sktime`, where I serve as a core developer. It's an incredible community-driven effort, and I'm thrilled to be a part of its development.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out to me if you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to connect. I'm always open to interesting collaborations and discussions!
